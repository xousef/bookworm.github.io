          <h3><a href="#project-link">Harry Potter/a></h3>
          <p>The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling is a collection of seven fantasy novels that follow the life of Harry Potter, an 11-year-old wizard who discovers he's the son of famous wizards and is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Each book in the series chronicles one year of Harry's life as he befriends fellow students and teachers, learns about the wizarding world, and overcomes obstacles to defeat the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. The series begins like a fairy tale, but the balance shifts as Harry faces an oppressive evil that uses lies and division to isolate and silence its opponents.
